# Student Performance Data Analysis and PowerBI
This dataset contains attributes from two Portuguese secondary schools. It includes information on students’ grades, demographic features, social and school-related features.
# Probleme Statement
Despite numerous educational interventions, many students continue to underperform academically, raising concerns about the underlying causes of low academic achievement. Among various factors influencing student success, the amount of time students dedicate to studying is widely considered to have a significant impact. However, the strength and nature of this relationship remain unclear in real-world educational settings.

This project aims to analyze the relationship between the number of hours students study per week (as captured by the studytime variable) and their academic performance (measured by final grades G3). Using the Student Performance dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, we seek to uncover patterns, correlations, and trends that can inform students, educators, and policymakers on how study habits relate to academic success.
# Project Objectives
 - To examine how study time (per week) influences students’ final academic performance.
 - To identify trends and patterns in academic achievement based on varying levels of study time.
 - To evaluate the strength of correlation between study time and final grades.
 - To visualize the relationship using data dashboards and statistical plots.
 - To provide recommendations that encourage effective study habits for improved academic outcomes.
   
# Research Questions
 > Is there a significant relationship between the number of hours students study and their final grades?
 > Do students who study more tend to perform better academically?
 > What is the distribution of study time among students, and how does it align with performance?
 > Are there other factors (e.g., absences or failures) that moderate the relationship between study time and performance?
